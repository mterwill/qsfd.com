        <p>Quaker Springs Fire is pleased and proud to announce the
		arrival of our new Lite Rescue truck. </p>
        <p>This truck is built on a 2022 Dodge RAM 5500 cab and chassis
		with a custom designed body fabricated by Upstate NY Plow &amp;
        Truck Body LLC. The custom body was designed to carry specialized
        rescue gear including: (4) air packs, an Automatic Electronic Defibrillator
        (AED), the jaws of life, airbags, rescue struts, a pneumatic light 
		tower for scene lighting, a 20‚Äù chain saw and assorted hand tools,
		ladder and more. </p>
		<p>This truck allows us to centralize our rescue equipment for faster
		response to a variety of emergency situations while its compact size 
		gives us the flexibility to respond to more situations than our larger trucks do. </p>
