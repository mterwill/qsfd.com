<p>The Quaker Springs Fire Department (QSFD) serves the rural area of the Town
of Saratoga New York. Our district has traditionally been a farming
community.</p>

<p>We protect a 50.2 square mile area.  The Fire District is surrounded on three
sides by major bodies of water - Saratoga Lake, Fish Creek and the Hudson
River.</p>

<p>The QSFD answers approximately 100 calls a year of which 14-16% are
fires.</p>

<p>There are approximately 45-50 members of the department.</p>

<p>When the department first started in 1947, Mrs. King would sound the church
bell for alarms. We then advanced to a siren and then to fully automatic pager
alert system where firefighters are notified of the alarm location and
nature.</p>

<p>The department has automatic daytime mutual aid agreements with Arvin Hart FD
(Town of Stillwater), Schuyler Hose (Schuylerville) and David Nevins FD (Victory
Mills). In addition, the department provides and receives mutual aid with
numerous departments in Saratoga and Washington Counties.</p>

<p>QSFD has enjoyed the support of our community in the Town of Saratoga for
many years.  QSFD looks forward to serving the community in the future with
dedicated personnel providing quality care and service to our residents.</p>
