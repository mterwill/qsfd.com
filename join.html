<h3>Help Wanted</h3>

<p>The Quaker Springs Fire Department is a volunteer organization that is accepting new members.</p>

<p>The Department serves 50.2 square miles in the Town of Saratoga and operates from two fire stations.  Station 1 is on Blodgett Road in Quaker Springs and Station 2 is on NYS Rt 9P at the north end of Saratoga Lake.  We respond to various emergency calls ranging from fires to motor vehicle accidents and boat rescues.</p>

<p>Volunteer firefighting can be very demanding - both physically and in time spent.  We respond to approximately 100 calls per year and training is scheduled on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>The Department offers its members various incentives in exchange for their dedicated service.  These incentives include a retirement system, extensive training and protective gear (including new coat and boots for all firefighters that successfully complete their probationary period).</p>

<p>Fire fighting can be a very rewarding experience. If you believe you have what it takes to meet the challenges of fire service, we invite you to stop by Station 1 any Thursday night.</p>
